# Hanami :cherry_blossom:

**A flexible framework for maintainable Ruby apps.**

Hanami is a **full-stack** Ruby web framework. It's made up of smaller, single-purpose libraries.

This repository is for the full-stack framework, which provides the glue that ties all the parts together:

* [**Hanami::Router**](https://github.com/hanami/router) - Rack compatible HTTP router for Ruby
* [**Hanami::Controller**](https://github.com/hanami/controller) - Full featured, fast and testable actions for Rack
* [**Hanami::View**](https://github.com/hanami/view) - Presentation with a separation between views and templates
* [**Hanami::DB**](https://github.com/hanami/db) - Database integration, complete with migrations, repositories, relations, and structs
* [**Hanami::Assets**](https://github.com/hanami/assets) - Assets management for Ruby

These components are designed to be used independently or together in a Hanami application.
