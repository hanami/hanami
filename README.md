# Hanami :cherry_blossom:

The web, with simplicity.

## Frameworks

Hanami is a **full-stack** Ruby web framework.
It's made up of smaller, single-purpose libraries.

This repository is for the full-stack framework,
which provides the glue that ties all the parts together:

* [**Hanami::Model**](https://github.com/hanami/model) - Persistence with entities, repositories and data mapper
* [**Hanami::View**](https://github.com/hanami/view) - Presentation with a separation between views and templates
* [**Hanami::Controller**](https://github.com/hanami/controller) - Full featured, fast and testable actions for Rack
* [**Hanami::Validations**](https://github.com/hanami/validations) - Validations mixin for Ruby objects
* [**Hanami::Router**](https://github.com/hanami/router) - Rack compatible HTTP router for Ruby
* [**Hanami::Helpers**](https://github.com/hanami/helpers) - View helpers for Ruby applications
* [**Hanami::Mailer**](https://github.com/hanami/mailer) - Mail for Ruby applications
* [**Hanami::Assets**](https://github.com/hanami/assets) - Assets management for Ruby
* [**Hanami::CLI**](https://github.com/hanami/cli) - Ruby command line interface
* [**Hanami::Utils**](https://github.com/hanami/utils) - Ruby core extensions and class utilities

These components are designed to be used independently or together in a Hanami application.

### How To Use Hanami HEAD

If you want to test Hanami's HEAD to try a new feature or to test a bug fix, here's how to do:

```
git clone https://github.com/hanami/hanami.git
cd hanami && bundle
bundle exec hanami new --hanami-head bookshelf
cd bookshelf
vim Gemfile # edit with: gem 'hanami', path: '..'
bundle
```

### Development Requirements

  * Ruby 2.3+ / JRuby 9.1.5.0+
  * Bundler
  * [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)
  * Node.js (MacOS)

### Testing

In order to simulate installed gems on developers' computers, the build installs
all the gems locally in `vendor/cache`, including `hanami` code from `lib/`.

**Before running a test, please make sure you have a fresh version of the code:**

```shell
./script/setup
bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/file_spec.rb
```

To run all the tests, please use:

```shell
./script/ci
```
