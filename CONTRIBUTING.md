Lotus is an open source project and we would love you to help us make it better.

## Reporting Issues

A well formatted issue is appreciated, and goes a long way in helping us help you.

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a [Github issue](./issues) by:
  * Clearly describing the issue
    * Provide a descriptive summary
    * Explain the expected behavior
    * Explain the actual behavior
    * Provide steps to reproduce the actual behavior
    * Provide your application's complete `Gemfile.lock` as text (in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) for bonus points)
    * Any relevant stack traces

If you provide code, make sure it is formatted with the triple backticks (\`).

At this point, we'd love to tell you how long it will take for us to respond,
but we just don't know.

## Pull requests

We accept pull requests to Lotus for:

* Adding documentation
* Fixing bugs
* Adding new features

Not all features proposed will be added but we are open to having a conversation
about a feature you are championing.

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. This is to make sure your starting point works. Tests can be
run via `rake`

3. Create a new branch and make your changes. This includes tests for features!

4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request. For more information, see
[Github's pull request help section](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

At this point you're waiting on us. Expect a conversation regarding your pull
request; Questions, clarifications, and so on.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Use Lotus idioms
* Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it
* Update the documentation, guides, etc.
