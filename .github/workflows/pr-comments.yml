# Downloads comment artifacts from completed workflows and posts them to PRs. This allows source
# workflows to run with read-only permissions on fork PRs while still posting comments via this
# privileged workflow that runs in the base repo context.

# Comment artifacts should be generated using the
# `hanakai-rb/repo-sync/shared-actions/pr-comment-artifact@main` action.
