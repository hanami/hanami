  # Ruby ecosystem compatibility
  #
  # Most of the hosting SaaS automatic tasks are designed after Ruby on Rails.
  # They expect the following Rake tasks to be present:
  #
  #   * db:migrate
  #   * assets:precompile
  #
  # See https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby/issues/442
  #
  # ===
  #
  # These Rake tasks are **NOT** listed when someone runs `rake -T`, because we
  # want to encourage developers to use `hanami` CLI commands.
  #
  # In order to migrate the database or compile assets a developer should use:
  #
  #   * hanami db migrate
  #   * hanami assets compile
  #
  # This is the preferred way to run Hanami command line tasks.
  # Please use them when you're in control of your deployment environment.
  #
  # If you're not in control and your deployment requires these "standard"
  # Rake tasks, they are here only to solve this specific problem.

  #   task :migrate do
