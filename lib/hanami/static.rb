module Hanami
  # Serve static assets in deployment environments (production, staging) where
  # the architecture doesn't include a web server.
  #
  # Web servers like Nginx are the ideal candidate to serve static assets.
  # They are faster than Ruby application servers (eg. Puma) and they should be
  # always preferred for this specific task.
  #
  # But there are some PaaS that don't allow to use web servers in front of Ruby
  # web applications. A classical example is Heroku, which requires the web
  # application to serve static assets.
  #
  # Hanami::Static is designed for this specific scenario.
  #
  # To enable it set the env variable `SERVE_STATIC_ASSETS` on `true`.
  #
  # NOTE: Please remember to precompile the assets at the deploy time with
  # `bundle exec hanami assets precompile`.
