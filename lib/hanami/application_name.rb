    # if it is invalid. Secondly, assuming it is not invalid, it must be able
    # to be output roughly as given, but with the following changes:
    #
    # 1. downcased,
    # 2. with surrounding spaces removed,
    # 3. with internal whitespace rendered as underscores
    # 4. with underscores de-duplicated
    #
    # which is the default output. It must also be transformable into an
    # environment variable.
