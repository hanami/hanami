  # HTTP/2 Early Hints Rack middleware

  # It sends extra responses **before** the main reponse is sent.
  # These extra responses are HTTP/2 Early Hints (103).
  # They specify the web assets (javascripts, stylesheets, etc..) to be "pushed",
  # so modern browsers pre-fetch them in parallel with the main HTTP response.
